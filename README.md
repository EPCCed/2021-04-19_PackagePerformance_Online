# Understanding Package Performance

This is not an official Carpentries lesson, but the Carpentries lesson template is excellent, so we are using it.
This is the development repo for the Understanding Package Performance course developed as part of 
the [UK National Supercomputing Service, ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk).
